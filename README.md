This was the code for the project originally created by Ray Wu, managing partner for Boundary Free Ventures. The overall function of this program is to scan through all of the YCombinator websites and grab specific pieces of information based on web-scraped data. As most of my previous programs, to gain more familiarity with Java, I wrote this program entirely in Java (minus some text files). The data, after being scraped and processed, now has a permanent home at https://ventures.media/tag/Y-Combinator/, go check it out if you have time!

If you have any issues or problems with getting it to work, feel free to open up an issues tab and let me know!
